  aboutMe:
    "I hold a BS-MS degree in Chemistry from IISER Mohali, where I developed strong skills in research, nanomaterials, and scientific reporting, alongside expertise in advanced material characterization techniques. 
Over the past two years, I have been preparing for the UPSC Civil Services Examination, which has honed my aptitude, critical thinking, problem-solving, and perseverance. This journey has also deepened my understanding of governance, public administration, environmental and socio-economic policies.
I am currently seeking PhD positions to advance my expertise in chemical sciences and contribute to cutting-edge research. I am particularly interested in synthesis of nanomaterials, their characterization and applications to address the real-world challenges.
I like to play badminton, practice yoga, do cooking, read literary novels, and watch interviews of people who are doing wonders in their field of work.",

      name: "Bi4TaO8Cl as a New Class of Layered Perovskite Oxyhalide Materials for Piezopotential Driven Efficient Seawater Splitting",
      description:
        "Piezocatalytic water splitting is an emerging approach to generate “green hydrogen” that can address several drawbacks of photocatalytic and electrocatalytic approaches. However, existing piezocatalysts are few and with minimal structural flexibility for engineering properties. Moreover, the scope of utilizing unprocessed water is yet unknown and may widely differ from competing techniques due to the constantly varying nature of surface potential. Herein, we present Bi4TaO8Cl as a representative of a class of layered perovskite oxyhalide piezocatalysts with high hydrogen production efficiency and exciting tailorable features including the layer number, multiple cation–anion combination options, etc. In the absence of any cocatalyst and scavenger, an ultrahigh production rate is achievable (1.5 mmol g–1 h–1), along with simultaneous generation of value-added H2O2. The production rate using seawater is somewhat less yet appreciably superior to photocatalytic H2 production by most oxides as well as piezocatalysts and has been illustrated using a double-layer model for further development.",

      name: "Role and Effect of Persistent Organic Pollutants to Our Environment and Wildlife",
      description: "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are toxic substances composed of carbon-based chemical compounds and mixtures. In recent times, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have emerged as a threat to wildlife and the environment. POPs are chemically stable, remain intact in the environment for long periods, are recalcitrant in nature, and are lipophilic. Therefore, they accumulate in the fatty tissues of living organisms and reside for longer periods, ultimately affecting humans and wildlife. It is believed that approximately 90% of human beings are exposed to POPs through their diets that contain animal products. These foods lead to bioaccumulation in fat tissues, which then causes health hazards. There are many studies available on their behavior in photocatalytic oxidation reactions; also, many research studies are underway to combat these toxic substances. In this chapter, we will take you through how persistent organic pollutants are affecting our environment and wildlife and what their roles are.",
